<h1>How to Create a Website Using GitHub</h1>
<br>
<br>
<body>
<p>1.       Go to www.github.com<br>

2.       Click the “Sign Up” button on the top right of the screen<br>

3.       Enter in your email, then click continue<br>

4.       Create a password, then click continue<br>

5.       Create a username, then click continue<br>

6.       Follow the steps to create your free account<br>

7.       You will be redirected to your Github profile, here you will click the green “New” button to create a <br>

8.       Your username will automatically be selected as the “Owner”, but you will have to create your own repository name (ex: cqriddle.github.io)<br>

9.       Once this repository is created, you will need to create a couple files to copy into it<br>

10.   Create a folder on your computer that you will put all files for this code/site in (ex: git-hub)<br>

11.   If you would like to add a picture as well, you can find one from the internet (make sure it is not licensed) or take one from your computer and put a copy of it in the folder you plan to use<br>

12.   Using a text editor like Notepad (I recommend installing Notepad++), we are going to create a file<br>

13.   In the file enter the following code:<br>
<xmp>
<html>
<h1> (your name) Portfolio </h>
<img src= " " />
</html>
</xmp><br>

 14.   Remove “(your name)” and enter in your first name<br>

15.   Say you decide to put a picture on the website. 
<xmp><img scr= “” /></xmp> is line where you will enter the information for the picture you selected. You need to take the image’s pathway and enter it between the “ “ of this line of code. Example:
 <xmp><img src=”./profilepic.jpg /></xmp><br>

16.   Once you have updated this code, you will want to save it as index.html (REMINDER: you want to save this in the file you created for this site and saved your photo to as well)<br>

17.   Now that you have your files created, you will copy them into your repository you created. Go back to your browser to the page it directed you to once you created the repository. Under “Quick Setup” there is an option to “add an existing file”- select this option.<br>

18.   This will bring you to a new window where you can drag and drop the files you just created. You can also select choose your files. Whichever method you use, copy the image you chose and the index.html file into here.<br>

19.   Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the green “commit changes” button- this will save your work<br>

20.   This completes the final step in creating your website. You can continue to edit your code and save changes if there are any further updates you need/want to make.<br>

21.   To see the website in it’s final form, you can open up a new tab and type in your repository name (ex: cqriddle.github.io) and it should populate if the code is correct
